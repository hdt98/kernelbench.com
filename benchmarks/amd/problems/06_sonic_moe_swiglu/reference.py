"""Naive grouped GEMM + fused SwiGLU reference (correctness only, NOT the SOTA).

This is the up-projection of an MoE FFN. Each token i is assigned to K experts;
expert_indices[i*K + j] tells you which expert. Tokens are dispatched to experts
according to routing metadata; we compute, per expert e:

    h_e = silu(x_e @ W_gate[e])  *  (x_e @ W_up[e])

where x_e is the slice of permuted hidden states routed to expert e, with
expert_offsets[e]:expert_offsets[e+1] giving its row range in the permuted layout.

The reference loops over experts in Python. Slow, but pedagogically clear and
correct. Forbidden ops (torch.matmul, torch.bmm, F.linear, sonic_moe imports)
are NOT used here, but the reference is exempt — only solution.py is checked.
